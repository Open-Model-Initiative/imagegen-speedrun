# ImageGen-Speedrun

We bring the spirit of nanogpt-speedrun into the omni-modal world

## Motivation

We have witnessed an impressive improvements on Diffusion models, especially with encoder improvements like REPA/E-REPA/RAE/REG, and also other areas of enhancement. Triggered by the experiment of [SpeedRun-DiT](https://github.com/SwayStar123/SpeedrunDiT), we as an open source community think it might be a worthy attempt to construct a speedrun (in the spirit of the great [nanogpt-speedrun](https://github.com/KellerJordan/modded-nanogpt) and [marin-speedrun](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/blob/main/docs/explanations/speedrun.md)) for diffusion models and multi-modal generation tasks.

## Heavy experimental and construction

[2026.01.16]
Note that this effort is purely grassroot with the support of [LFAI&Data Foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation/) for Open Model Initiative, it will undergo some dramatic changes, but we intend to document every dicussion publicly and making the process as transparent as possible
